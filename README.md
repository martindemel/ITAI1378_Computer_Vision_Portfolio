# My ITAI1378 Learning Journey - Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my work for the ITAI 1378 Computer Vision course at Houston Community College. Through hands-on personal projects and team collaboration, I gained practical experience applying techniques such as object detection, image classification, and neural networks. The course focused on technical aspects, ethical considerations, and real-world applications of Computer Vision in Artificial intelligence. Each module and assignment deepened my understanding of how computer vision is pivotal in industries like healthcare, security, and autonomous systems.
