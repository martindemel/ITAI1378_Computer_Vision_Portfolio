# L06 Chihuahua or Muffin

This assignment challenged me to develop a simple neural network classifier to differentiate between images of chihuahuas and muffins.  I delved into essential neural network concepts including:

* **Forward Propagation:**  The process of passing input data through the network to obtain predictions.
* **Backward Propagation:** Calculating gradients and updating network weights to minimize errors.
* **Optimization Techniques:** Algorithms like gradient descent used to adjust model parameters and improve accuracy.
* **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Strategies to adjust the learning rate during training for better convergence.

**Data Preprocessing:**

To prepare the image data for the
