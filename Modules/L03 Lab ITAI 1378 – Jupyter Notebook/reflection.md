# L03 Lab ITAI 1378 - Jupyter Notebook

This lab session refreshed my skills with GitHub and Jupyter Notebook. After recovering access to my GitHub account, I:

* Created a new repository, "Jupyter-exploration".
* Added a readme file summarizing the lab purpose.

In Jupyter Notebook, I:

* Created and formatted markdown cells.
* Wrote basic Python code (`print("Hello, World!")`).
* Uploaded the notebook to GitHub.

While I primarily use Visual Studio Code, I found Jupyter's focus on data analysis and visualization a valuable tool for future projects.
