# A01 Intro to Computer Vision - Historical Timeline of Computer Vision

During our initial assignment, we created a timeline for the significant advancements in computer vision from 2020 to 2024. Our timeline showcased milestones such as:

* **NVIDIA's Ampere architecture**
* **YOLOv4 for object detection**
* **Vision Transformers (ViT)**

We also examined ethical considerations, such as:

* **Fei-Fei Li's advocacy for AI ethics in healthcare**
* **The European Union's AI Act**

Our collaborative effort deepened our understanding of how computer vision has evolved and its transformative impact across industries.
