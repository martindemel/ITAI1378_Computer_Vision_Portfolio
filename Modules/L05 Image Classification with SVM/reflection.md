# L05 Image Classification with SVM

This assignment involved exploring Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It was my first experience with SVM, and I deepened my understanding by researching concepts like:

* **Hyperplanes:** The decision boundaries that separate different classes in an SVM model.
* **Linear vs. Nonlinear Kernels:**  Different functions used to map data into higher-dimensional space, allowing for more complex classifications.
* **The "Kernel Trick":** A technique to efficiently perform computations in high-dimensional space without explicitly calculating the transformations.

**Lab Setup and Preprocessing:**

* Built the lab environment from scratch.
* Preprocessed the CIFAR-10 dataset:
    * Converted images to grayscale.
    * Normalized pixel values.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets.

This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into the workings of SVM and its application in image classification tasks.
