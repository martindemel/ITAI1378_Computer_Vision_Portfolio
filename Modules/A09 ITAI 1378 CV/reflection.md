# A09 ITAI 1378 CV - Object Detection Cheat Sheet

Our team collaborated to create an object detection cheat sheet, a comprehensive guide to understanding the key concepts, methodologies, and challenges involved in identifying and locating objects within images.

**Key Concepts Covered:**

* **Regional Proposals:** Techniques for generating potential regions of interest in an image that may contain objects.
* **Bounding Boxes:**  Defining rectangular boxes around detected objects to specify their location and size.
* **Classification:** Assigning labels to the objects detected within the bounding boxes.
* **Output Optimization:** Methods like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine the final set of detected objects and eliminate redundant or overlapping bounding boxes.

**Algorithms Analyzed:**

We explored several popular object detection algorithms, including:

* **R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks):**  A pioneering approach that combines regional proposals with CNNs for accurate object detection.
* **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector):**  A faster algorithm that performs object detection in a single forward pass of the network.
* **YOLO (You Only Look Once):**  A highly efficient real-time object detection algorithm that predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the input image.

**Strengths and Applications:**

We analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, considering factors such as:

* **Speed:** How quickly the algorithm can process images and detect objects.
* **Accuracy:** The precision of the object detection results.
* **Real-time Detection:**  The ability to perform object detection in real-time applications like video analysis.

This project provided a valuable overview of the field of object detection, highlighting the diverse approaches and algorithms used to tackle this challenging task.
