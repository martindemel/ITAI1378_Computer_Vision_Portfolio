# L01 Exploring Real-World Applications of Computer Vision

From a young age, I've been fascinated by computers and their real-world applications, especially in healthcare. I was inspired by my mom's work and discussions with my friend Ray, an MRI technician. 

This assignment explored how AI and deep learning improve medical image analysis. They enhance diagnostics with:

* **Faster scans:** Reducing MRI scan times from 30 minutes to 10.
* **Sharper images:** Improving image quality for better diagnosis.

While advancements offer incredible benefits, challenges remain:

* **High costs:** Implementing AI technology can be expensive.
* **"Black box" nature of AI:** Understanding how AI algorithms make decisions can be difficult.

I believe this field holds immense promise for early detection and better patient outcomes.
