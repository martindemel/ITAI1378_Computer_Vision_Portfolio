# A04 "Image Processing Adventure Quest"

Our team collaborated on a creative project, crafting a narrative titled "Image Processing Adventure Quest" to explore color models and their applications.

**The Story:**

The story followed Investigator Pixels, who explained the differences between RGB and CMYK models:

* **RGB (Additive Model):** Used in digital devices like screens.
* **CMYK (Subtractive Model):** Used in printing processes.

**Other Color Models Explored:**

* **HSL** (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
* **LAB** (CIELAB color space)

This project allowed us to creatively explore the fascinating world of color models and their diverse uses in various applications.
