# L07 Chihuahua or Muffin with CNN

This assignment took my image classification skills to the next level! I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of chihuahuas and muffins, and achieved a **96.88% validation accuracy** after just 10 epochs.

**Why CNNs?**

Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs excel at image classification because they:

* **Preserve Spatial Relationships:**  CNNs maintain the spatial relationships between pixels in an image, allowing them to learn features like edges, corners, and textures more effectively.

**My CNN Architecture:**

* **Convolutional Layers:**  I used convolutional layers with **ReLU activation functions** and filters to detect patterns in the images.
* **MaxPooling Layers:** I incorporated MaxPooling layers to downsample feature maps and reduce the computational complexity of the network.

**Key Takeaways:**

* This project provided valuable hands-on experience in building and training a CNN for image classification.
* I gained a deeper understanding of how CNN architecture, including convolutional and pooling layers, contributes to their effectiveness in image-related tasks.
* Achieving high accuracy demonstrated the power of CNNs for accurately classifying even challenging image datasets.
